\section{Cursed Items}

Cursed items are magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact. Sometimes 
they're directly bad for the user; sometimes they're just inconvenient. Occasionally 
they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices.

\textbf{Delusion: }The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it 
actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled 
into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without 
the help of a \textit{remove curse }spell.

\textbf{Opposite Effect or Target:} These cursed items malfunction, so that either 
they do the opposite of what the creator intended, or they target the user instead 
of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items 
aren't always bad to have. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties 
on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn't necessarily 
immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn't 
immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can 
be discarded unless some sort of compulsion is placed upon it that compels the 
wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a \textit{remove curse }spell is generally 
needed to get rid of the item.

\textbf{Intermittent Functioning:} The three varieties of intermittent functioning 
items all function perfectly as described---at least some of the time. The three 
varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.

\textit{Unreliable: }Each time the item is activated, there is a 5\% chance (01-05 
on d\%) that it does not function.

\textit{Dependent: }The item only functions in certain situations. To determine 
what the situation is, either select a situation or roll on the following table.

\textit{Uncontrolled: }An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. 
Roll d\% every day. On a result of 01-05 the item activates at some random point 
during that day. 

\textbf{Requirement:} In a sense, a command word is a requirement. Nevertheless, 
some items have much more stringent requirements that must be met for them to be 
usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the 
following conditions must be met.•

Character must eat twice as much as normal.•

Character must sleep twice as much as normal.•

Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and then item functions 
normally thereafter).•

Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp worth of valuables per day.•

Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.•

Character must swear fealty to a particular noble or his family.•

Character must discard all other magic items.•

Character must worship a particular deity.•

Character must change her name to a specific name. (The item only works for characters 
of that name.)•

Character must add a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class 
already.•

Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.•

Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) 
one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a \textit{restoration 
}spell), the item ceases functioning. (The item does not cease functioning if the 
character receives a Constitution increase caused by level gain, a \textit{wish, 
}or the use of a magic item.)•

Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.•

Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.•

Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.•

Item must be used at least once a day, or it won't function again for its current 
possessor.•

Item must draw blood when wielded (weapons only). It can't be put away or exchanged 
for another weapon until it has scored a hit.•

Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as \textit{bless, 
atonement, }or \textit{animate objects}).

Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the item that they should never 
be determined randomly. An item with a requirement that is also intelligent often 
imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, 
the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day 
before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time 
only, others monthly, and still others continuous).

\textbf{Drawback:} Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor 
but they also carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only 
when the item is used (or held, in the case of some items such as weapons), usually 
the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.

Roll on the table below to generate a drawback that (unless otherwise indicated) 
remains in effect as long as the item is in the character's possession.

SPECIFIC CURSED ITEMS

Specific Cursed Items are provided as examples of cursed items. They are given 
creation prerequisites, should someone want to intentionally create them (although 
that does not need to be the origin of the item). Note, however, two exceptions: 
The \textit{crystal hypnosis ball }and the \textit{bag of devouring }cannot be 
created by any known means.

A simple \textit{detect magic }spell yields a misleading aura and strength, often 
indicating that the item is a noncursed item of similar sort. An \textit{identify 
}spell only has a 1\% chance per caster level to reveal a cursed item's true properties, 
including the cursed aspect. \textit{Analyze dweomer }reveals the true nature of 
a cursed item.

\vspace{12pt}
\textbf{Amulet of Inescapable Location:} This device is typically worn on a chain 
or as a brooch. It appears, to magical analysis, to prevent location, scrying or 
detection or influence by \textit{detect thoughts }or telepathy. It seems to be 
an \textit{amulet of proof against detection and location}. Actually, the amulet 
gives the wearer a -10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.

Moderate abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,000 gp.

\textbf{Armor of Arrow Attraction:} Magical analysis indicates that this armor 
is a normal suit of \textit{+3 full plate. }However, the armor is cursed. It works 
normally with regard to melee attacks but actually serves to attract ranged weapons. 
The wearer takes a -15 penalty to AC against any attack by a ranged weapon. The 
true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon 
in earnest.

Strong abjuration; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
9,000 gp.

\textbf{Armor of Rage: }This armor is similar in appearance to \textit{armor of 
command }and functions as a suit of \textit{+1 full plate}. However, when it is 
worn, the armor causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly 
characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. 
The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. (In other words, 
the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her 
problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.)

Strong necromancy; CL 16th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,600 gp.

\textbf{Bag of Devouring: }This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for 
magical properties makes it seem as if it were a \textit{bag of holding}. The sack 
is, however, a lure used by an extradimensional creature---in fact, one of its 
feeding orifices.

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to ``swallowing'' if thrust 
within the bag. The \textit{bag of devouring }is 90\% likely to ignore any initial 
intrusion, but any time thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as 
if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60\% likely to close 
around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has 
a +8 bonus on grapple checks made to pull someone in.

The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a \textit{bag of holding 
type I, }but each hour it has a 5\% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents 
and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures 
drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents 
any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is 
a 50\% chance that a \textit{wish, miracle, }or \textit{true resurrection }spell 
can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. 
If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic.

Moderate conjuration; CL 17th; In effect, this is a creature and cannot be created; 
Price n/a.

\textbf{Boots of Dancing:} These boots initially appear and function as one of 
the other kinds of magic boots. But when the wearer is in (or fleeing from) melee 
combat, \textit{boots of dancing }impede movement, making him behave as if \textit{irresistible 
dance }had been cast upon him. Only a \textit{remove curse }spell enables the wearer 
to be rid of the boots once their true nature is revealed.

Strong enchantment; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{irresistible dance; 
}Price 30,000 gp.

\textbf{Bracers of Defenselessness: }These appear to be \textit{bracers of armor 
+5 }and actually serve as such until the wearer is attacked in anger by an enemy 
with a Challenge Rating equal to or greater than her level. At that moment and 
thereafter, the bracers cause a -5 penalty to AC. Once their curse is activated, 
\textit{bracers of defenselessness }can be removed only by means of a \textit{remove 
curse }spell.

Moderate conjuration; CL 16th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{mage armor, bestow 
curse; }Price 1,200 gp.

\textbf{Broom of Animated Attack:} This item is indistinguishable in appearance 
from a normal broom. It is identical to a \textit{broom of flying }by all tests 
short of attempted use.

If a command is spoken, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, 
dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since 
the fall is less than 10 feet). The broom then attacks the victim, swatting the 
face with the straw or twig end and beating him with the handle end.

The broom gets two attacks per round with each end (two swats with the straw and 
two with the handle, for a total of four attacks per round). It attacks with a 
+5 bonus on each attack roll. The straw end causes a victim to be blinded for 1 
round when it hits. The handle deals 1d6 points of damage when it hits. The broom 
has AC 13, 18 hit points, and hardness 4.

Moderate transmutation; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{fly, animate objects; 
}Price 5,200 gp.

\textbf{Cloak of Poisonousness:} This cloak is usually made of a woolen material, 
although it can be made of leather. A \textit{detect poison }spell can reveal the 
presence of poison impregnated in the cloak's fabric. The garment can be handled 
without harm, but as soon as it is actually donned the wearer is killed instantly 
unless she succeeds on a DC 28 Fortitude save.

Once donned, a \textit{cloak of poisonousness }can be removed only with a \textit{remove 
curse }spell; doing this destroys the magical property of the cloak. If a \textit{neutralize 
poison }spell is then used, it is possible to revive the victim with a \textit{raise 
dead }or \textit{resurrection }spell, but not before.

Strong abjuration; CL 15th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{poison, }and \textit{limited 
wish }or \textit{miracle; }Price 62,000 gp.

\textbf{Crystal Hypnosis Ball:} This cursed item is indistinguishable from a normal 
\textit{crystal ball. }However, anyone attempting to use the scrying device becomes 
fascinated for 1d6 minutes, and a telepathic \textit{suggestion }is implanted in 
his mind (Will DC 19 negates).

The user of the device believes that the desired creature or scene was viewed, 
but actually he came under the influence of a powerful wizard, lich, or even some 
power or being from another plane. Each further use brings the \textit{crystal 
hypnosis ball }gazer deeper under the influence of the controller, either as a 
servant or a tool. Note that throughout this time, the user remains unaware of 
his subjugation.

Moderate divination; CL 17th; In effect, this is a minor artifact and cannot be 
created; Price n/a.

\textbf{Dust of Sneezing and Choking:} This fine dust appears to be \textit{dust 
of appearance. }If cast into the air, it causes those within a 20- foot spread 
to fall into fits of sneezing and coughing. Those failing a DC 15 Fortitude save 
take 2d6 points of Constitution damage immediately. In addition, those failing 
a second DC 15 Fortitude save 1 minute later are dealt 1d6 points of Constitution 
damage. Those who succeed on either saving throw are nonetheless disabled by choking 
(treat as stunned) for 5d4 rounds.

Faint conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{poison; }Price 2,400 gp.

\textbf{Flask of Curses:} This item looks like an ordinary beaker, bottle, container, 
decanter, flask, or jug. It may contain a liquid, or it may emit smoke. When the 
flask is first unstoppered, all within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save or be 
cursed, taking a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks until 
a \textit{remove curse }spell is cast upon them.

Moderate conjuration; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
2,100 gp.

\textbf{Gauntlets of Fumbling:} These gauntlets may be of supple leather or heavy 
protective material suitable for use with armor. In the former instance, they appear 
to be \textit{gloves of Dexterity. }In the latter case, they appear to be \textit{gauntlets 
of ogre power. }The gauntlets perform according to every test as if they were \textit{gloves 
of Dexterity }or \textit{gauntlets of ogre power }until the wearer finds herself 
under attack or in a life-and-death situation. At that time, the curse is activated. 
The wearer becomes fumble-fingered, with a 50\% chance each round of dropping anything 
held in either hand. The gauntlets also lower Dexterity by 2 points. Once the curse 
is activated, the gloves can be removed only by means of a \textit{remove curse 
}spell, a \textit{wish, }or a \textit{miracle.}

Moderate transmutation; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
1,300 gp.

\textbf{Helm of Opposite Alignment:} This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. 
When placed upon the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 
15 negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically altered 
to an alignment as different as possible from the former alignment---good to evil, 
chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration 
in alignment is mental as well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic 
thoroughly enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can continue 
to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse, but if he takes it 
off and later puts it on again, another save is required. The curse only works 
once; that is, a character whose alignment has been changed cannot change it again 
by donning the helmet a second time.

Only a \textit{wish }or a \textit{miracle }can restore former alignment, and the 
affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former alignment. 
(In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in any way possible.) 
If a character of a class with an alignment requirement is affected, an \textit{atonement 
}spell is needed as well if the curse is to be obliterated. When a \textit{helm 
of opposite alignment }has functioned once, it loses its magical properties.

Strong transmutation; CL 12th; Create Wondrous Item, creator must be 12th level; 
Price 4,000 gp;Weight 3 lb.

\textbf{Incense of Obsession:} These blocks of incense appear to be \textit{incense 
of meditation. }If meditation and prayer are conducted while \textit{incense of 
obsession }is burning nearby, its odor and smoke cause the user to become totally 
confident that her spell ability is superior, due to the magic incense. The user 
is determined to use her spells at every opportunity, even when not needed or when 
useless. The user remains obsessed with her abilities and spells until all have 
been used or cast, or until 24 hours have elapsed.

Moderate enchantment; CL 6th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse; }Price 
200 gp.

\textbf{Mace of Blood:} This \textit{+3 heavy mace }must be coated in blood every 
day, or its bonus fades away (until the mace is coated again). The character using 
this mace must make a DC 13 Will save every day it is within his possession or 
become chaotic evil.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, creator must be at least 
9th level and chaotic evil; Price 16,000 gp.

\textbf{Medallion of Thought Projection:} This device seems like a \textit{medallion 
of thoughts}, even down to the range at which it functions, except that the thoughts 
overheard are muffled and distorted, requiring a DC 15 Will save to sort out. However, 
while the user thinks she is picking up the thoughts of others, all she is really 
hearing are figments created by the medallion itself. These illusory thoughts always 
seem plausible and thus can seriously mislead any who rely upon them. What's worse, 
unknown to her, the cursed medallion actually broadcasts her thoughts to creatures 
in the path of the beam, thus alerting them to her presence.

Faint divination; CL 7th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{detect thoughts, ghost 
sound; }Price 1,800 gp.

\textbf{Necklace of Strangulation:} A \textit{necklace of strangulation }appears 
to be a rare and wondrous piece of valuable jewelry and, short of the use of something 
as powerful as a \textit{miracle }or a \textit{wish}, can only be identified as 
a cursed item when placed around a character's neck. The necklace immediately constricts, 
dealing 6 points of damage per round. It cannot be removed by any means short of 
a \textit{limited wish, wish, }or \textit{miracle }and remains clasped around the 
victim's throat even after his death. Only when he has decayed to a dry skeleton 
(after approximately one month) does the necklace loosen, ready for another victim.

Strong conjuration; CL 18th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slay living; }Price 
60,000 gp.

\textbf{Net of Snaring: }This net provides a +3 bonus on attack rolls but can only 
be used underwater, thus making it a somewhat useful item rather than what most 
would really call a cursed item. Underwater, it can be commanded to shoot forth 
up to 30 feet to trap a creature.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{freedom of movement; 
}Price 10,000 gp.

\textbf{Periapt of Foul Rotting:} This engraved gem appears to be of little value. 
If any character keeps the periapt in her possession for more than 24 hours, she 
contracts a terrible rotting affliction that permanently drains 1 point of Dexterity, 
Constitution, and Charisma every week. The periapt (and the affliction) can be 
removed only by application of a \textit{remove curse }spell followed by a \textit{cure 
disease }and then a \textit{heal, miracle, limited wish}, or \textit{wish }spell. 
The rotting can also be countered by crushing a \textit{periapt of health }and 
sprinkling its dust upon the afflicted character (a full-round action), whereupon 
the periapt of foul rotting likewise crumbles to dust.

Faint abjuration; CL 10th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{contagion; }Price 17,000 
gp.

\textbf{Potion of Poison:} This potion has lost its once beneficial magical abilities 
and has become a potent poison. The imbiber must make a DC 16 Fortitude save or 
take 1d10 points of Constitution damage. A minute later he must save again (DC 
16) or take 1d10 points of Constitution damage.

Moderate conjuration; CL 12th; Craft Wondrous Item, \textit{poison; }Price 5,000 
gp.

\textbf{Robe of Powerlessness: }A \textit{robe of powerlessness }appears to be 
a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes 
a -10 penalty to Strength and Intelligence, forgetting spells and magic knowledge 
accordingly. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, 
the character must receive a \textit{remove curse }spell followed by \textit{heal}.

Moderate transmutation; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{bestow curse, permanency; 
}Price 5,500 gp.

\textbf{Robe of Vermin:} The wearer notices nothing unusual when the robe is donned, 
other than that it offers great magical defense (as a \textit{cloak of protection 
+4}). However, as soon as he is in a situation requiring concentration and action 
against hostile opponents, the true nature of the garment is revealed: The wearer 
immediately suffers a multitude of bites from the insects that magically infest 
the garment. He must cease all other activities in order to scratch, shift the 
robe, and generally show signs of the extreme discomfort caused by the bites and 
movement of these pests.

The wearer takes a -5 penalty on initiative checks and a -2 penalty on all attack 
rolls, saves, and skill checks. If he tries to cast a spell, he must make a Concentration 
check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell.

Moderate abjuration; CL 13th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{summon swarm, }creator 
must be at least 13th level; Price 16,500 gp.

\textbf{Ring of Clumsiness:} This ring operates exactly like a \textit{ring of 
feather falling}. However, it also makes the wearer clumsy. She takes a -4 penalty 
to Dexterity and has a 20\% chance of spell failure when trying to cast any arcane 
spell that has a somatic component. (This chance of spell failure stacks with other 
arcane spell failure chances.)

Strong transmutation; CL 15th; Forge Ring, \textit{feather fall, bestow curse; 
}Price 500 gp.

\textbf{Scarab of Death: }This small pin appears to be any one of the various beneficial 
amulets, brooches, or scarabs. However, if it is held for more than 1 round or 
carried by a living creature for 1 minute, it changes into a horrible burrowing 
beetlelike creature. The thing tears through any leather or cloth, burrows into 
flesh, and reaches the victim's heart in 1 round, causing death. A DC 25 Reflex 
save allows the wearer to tear the scarab away before it burrows out of sight, 
but he still takes 3d6 points of damage. The beetle then returns to its scarab 
form. Placing the scarab in a container of wood, ceramic, bone, ivory, or metal 
prevents the monster from coming to life and allows for long-term storage of the 
item.

Strong abjuration; CL 19th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slay living; }Price 80,000 
gp.

\textbf{Spear, Cursed Backbiter:} This is a \textit{+2 shortspear, }but each time 
it is used in melee against a foe and the attack roll is a natural 1, it damages 
its wielder instead of her intended target. When the curse takes effect, the spear 
curls around to strike its wielder in the back, automatically dealing the damage 
to the wielder. The curse even functions when the spear is hurled, and in such 
a case the damage to the hurler is doubled.

Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse; 
}Price 7,500 gp.

\textbf{Stone of Weight (Loadstone):} This stone appears to be a dark, smoothly 
polished stone. It reduces the possessor's base land speed to one-half of normal. 
Once picked up, the stone cannot be disposed of by any nonmagical means---if it 
is thrown away or smashed, it reappears somewhere on his person. If a \textit{remove 
curse }spell is cast upon a \textit{loadstone, }the item may be discarded normally 
and no longer haunts the individual.

Faint transmutation; CL 5th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{slow; }Price 1,000 gp.-

\textbf{2 Sword, Cursed:} This longsword performs well against targets in practice, 
but when used against an opponent in combat, it causes its wielder to take a -2 
penalty on attack rolls.

All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point 
of damage on any successful hit. After one week in a character's possession, the 
sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The 
sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to 
draw or ready some other weapon. The sword can be gotten rid of only by means of 
\textit{limited wish}, \textit{wish, }or \textit{miracle}.

Strong evocation; CL 15th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{bestow curse, }and 
\textit{limited wish }or \textit{miracle; }Price 1,500 gp.

\textbf{Sword, Berserking: }This item appears to have the characteristics of a 
\textit{+2 greatsword. }However, whenever the sword is used in battle, its wielder 
goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). 
He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead 
or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as 
a cursed object, others see it as a boon.

Moderate evocation; CL 8th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, \textit{rage, bestow curse; 
}Price 17,500 gp.

\textbf{Vacuous Grimoire: }A book of this sort looks like a normal one on some 
mildly interesting topic. Any character who opens the work and reads so much as 
a single word therein must make two DC 15 Will saves. The first is to determine 
if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence drain. The second is to find 
out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, 
a character must burn it while casting \textit{remove curse}. If the grimoire is 
placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look 
of those other works.

Strong enchantment; CL 20th; Create Wondrous Item, \textit{feeblemind; }Price 6,000
