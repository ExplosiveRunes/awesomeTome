\spellentry{Summon Nature's Ally IV}

Conjuration (Summoning) [see text]

\textbf{Level:} Animal 4, Drd 4, Rgr 4

\textbf{Effect:} One or more creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. 
apart

This spell functions like \textit{summon nature's ally I}, except that you can 
summon one 4th-level creature, 1d3 3rd-level creatures of the same kind, or 1d4+1 
lower-level creatures of the same kind.

When you use a summoning spell to summon an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, 
lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type.
