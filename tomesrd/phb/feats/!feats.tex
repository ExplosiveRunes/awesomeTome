\section{[Celestial] and [Fiend] Feats} \label{feats:outsider}

A feat with the [Celestial] or [Fiend] tag can only be taken by a creature who is an Outsider. For this purpose, any creature from any upper plane is a Celestial regardless of its alignment, while any creature from any lower plane is a Fiend regardless of its alignment. Further, any elemental or outsider with a Good alignment is a Celestial regardless of its plane of origin., while any elemental or outsider with an Evil alignment is a Fiend regardless of its plane of origin. The abilities granted by feats with the [Celestial] or [Fiend] tag are Extraordinary abilities unless otherwise stated. A Celestial does not gain a Fiendish trait from taking a [Celestial] feat that also has the [Fiend] tag.
