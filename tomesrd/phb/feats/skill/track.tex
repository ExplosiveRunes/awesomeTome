You feel at home no matter where you are.}{
Survival ranks:}{
You can follow tracks using Survival, as the Track and Legendary Tracker feats.}{
You can identify the race/kind of creatures from their tracks.}{
You can move through or over difficult natural terrain without being slowed, taking nonlethal damage, or suffering other impairment. You take no penalties for moving your speed when tracking, and only -10 when moving double your speed. You can track subjects protected by \spell{pass without trace} or similar spells at a -20 penalty.}{
You can track through the Astral Plane with a DC 35 Survival check. You can determine the destination of a teleportation spell when standing at the point of departure with a DC 40 Survival check; if you have \spell{teleport} or a similar spell, you can follow as if you had seen the destination once.}{
You're immune to natural planar effects as if you had \spell{planar tolerance} always active.}

\hypertarget{feat:tyrant}{}\skillfeat{Tyrant [Skill] [Leadership]}{
You push people around and get larger and larger groups trapped in the iron gauntlet of your brutal rule.}{
Intimidate ranks:}{
You inspire such terror that creatures you intimidate continue to act intimidated after you leave, too afraid to raise their voice in defiance even after you have apparently left them far behind.}{
You can muster a group of followers. Your leadership score is your ranks in Intimidate plus your Strength modifier.}{
Your followers swell in number to that of an army.}{
Your mere presence inspires fear and can break a battle. Enemies with more than 5 hit dice less than you do must make a Will save (DC 10 + Â½ Level + Strength Modifier) of flee in panic. This is a [Fear] effect.}{
Your presence causes despair in even brave opponents. All enemies within 30' of your suffer a -2 Morale penalty to Willpower saves.}
